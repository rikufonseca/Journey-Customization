__Goal__: 1 week to create an app with features similar to basic Airbnb functions: Someone offers something to rent, someone else looks for something to rent, offer can meet demand.


### About the product:

Journey Customization offers the possibility to book places/activities that have been suggested by other users.<br>
We used it to prepare seeds for our next project (see Globp@cker). <br>
The front is designed to be seen from a smartphone.<br>
The app uses [le wagon minimal rails template](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.
